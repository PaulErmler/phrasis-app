        "question": "What is Cacatua?",
        "answer": [
          "Cacatua is an audio-first language learning app. Unlike traditional apps, you can learn hands-free while commuting, exercising, or doing chores. It reads out sentences in one language and then you have some time to come up with the translation before the app tells you the correct answer and moves on to the next sentence.",
          "If you don't understand something, you can ask a state of the art language model to explain it to you. You can also let it create new flashcards for you."

        "question": "Is Cacatua free?",
        "answer": [
          "Cacatua offers a free tier such that you can try it. Unfortunately, we cannot offer it completely free as we have to cover our running costs. If you need higher limits you can upgrade to our Basic or Pro plans."
        ]
      },
      {
        "question": "How does Cacatua work?",
        "answer": [
          "Cacatua uses audio flashcards that play phrases in your target language, followed by the translation. You can rate how well you knew each phrase, and our spaced repetition algorithm shows the card again when you are likely about to forget it.",
          "If you dont understand a phrase you can ask the AI tutor questions anytime — like 'How can I say this more politely?' or 'Give me 3 more examples with this verb in a different tense.' We generate natural-sounding audio using state of the art text-to-speech technology."
        ]
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I add my own phrases?",
        "answer": [
          "Absolutely! You can either upload images, PDF, CSV or text files and Cacatua will automatically create flashcards for you. You can also add your own flashcards manually.",
          "Are we missing a method that you would like to use? Let us know and we will try to add it."
        ]
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does it take to get fluent?",
        "answer": [
          "Fluency depends on many factors: the language, your native language, daily practice time, and learning methods.",
          "The goal of Cacatua is to give you all the tools you need to learn it as fast as possible. For instance Cacatua teaches you new words in the order they appear most commonly. This way you can become fluent faster in more contexts because you learn the most frequent words first."
        ]
      },
      {
        "question": "What languages does Cacatua support?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Why is Cacatua a subscription?",
        "answer": [
          "Running AI models for voice generation and intelligent tutoring has ongoing costs. You can try it for free and see if it works for you.",
          "Cacatua can save you a lot of time e.g. because you can learn while on the go and it makes learning new sentences and vocabulary way easier."
